* ## [Labyrinth Simulation](https://github.com/Bhumika-Kothwal/Eklavya-2020--Slayers.git)
  * A maze solving robot simulation in Coppeliasim software using BFS algorithm to find the path. In Dry Run it explores the whole maze and then returns to the starting point. In Final Run the bot takes the shortest path to reach its destination in minimum time possible.
